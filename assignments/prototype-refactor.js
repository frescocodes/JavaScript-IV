Prototype Refactor

1. Copy and paste your code or the solution from yesterday

2. Your goal is to refactor all of this code to use ES6 Classes. The console.log() statements should still return what is expected of them.

/************* COPIED CODE  ****************/

/*
  Object oriented design is commonly used in video games.  For this part of the assignment you will be implementing several constructor functions with their correct inheritance hierarchy.

  In this file you will be creating three constructor functions: GameObject, CharacterStats, Humanoid.  

  At the bottom of this file are 3 objects that all end up inheriting from Humanoid.  Use the objects at the bottom of the page to test your constructor functions.
  
  Each constructor function has unique properties and methods that are defined in their block comments below:
*/
  
/*
  === GameObject ===
  * createdAt
  * name
  * dimensions (These represent the character's size in the video game)
  * destroy() // prototype method that returns: `${this.name} was removed from the game.`
*/

class GameObject {
    constructor(attrs){
        this.createdAt = attrs.createdAt; //attrs refers to the newly created obj properties that will become "this"
        this.name = attrs.name;
        this.dimensions = attrs.dimensions;
        // anything you need as direct properties will be bound here in constructor
    }
    destroy() { return `${this.name} was removed from the game.` }
}

/*
function GameObject(attrs){
